=== Integration with Micronaut Test Resources

https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-test-resources/latest/guide/index.html[Micronaut Test Resources] adds
support for managing external resources which are required during development or testing. In particular, it integrates
with https://www.testcontainers.org/[Testcontainers] to provide throwaway containers for resources like databases or
other external services like Kafka or RabbitMQ.

Test resources are handled by a "test resources service" which is a server accepting requests for test resources, which
lifecycle is handled by the Gradle plugin. A test resources request is, to simplify, a request to resolve a missing
configuration property. For example, if the kafka.bootstrap-servers property isnâ€™t set, Micronaut will query the test
resources service for the value of this property. This will trigger the creation of a Kafka test container, and the
service will answer with the URI to the bootstrap server.

You can enable test resources support by adding the following elements to your `pom.xml`:

.Maven
[source,xml]
----
<project>
    <properties>
        <micronaut.test.resources.enabled>true</micronaut.test.resources.enabled>
    </properties>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>io.micronaut.testresources</groupId>
            <artifactId>micronaut-test-resources-client</artifactId>
            <scope>test</scope>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</project>
----

This will be sufficient for most use cases, and Micronaut will automatically start containers, for example, when a
particular property is not present in your configuration and that you run tests (`mvn test`) or the application in
development mode (`mvn mn:run`).

For example, if the `datasources.default.url` configuration property is missing, and that your configuration contains:

[source,yaml]
----
datasources:
  default:
    dialect: MYSQL
----

Then a MySQL database will automatically be started and available for use in your tests: the url, username and password
configuration properties will automatically be injected to your application.

Please refer to the https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-test-resources/latest/guide/index.html[Micronaut Test
Resources documentation] for a list of all supported modules and their configuration options.

==== Standalone Test Resource Service

The default behaviour works particularly well in single-module projects, or in multi-module projects where test resources
are not shared between modules. However, in some cases, you may want to reuse test containers for multiple projects of
the same multi-project build, in order to save startup times for example.

For example, imagine a multi-project build which consists of :

* A Kafka consumer.
* A Kafka producer.
* Functional tests integrating both.

If each project enables the Test Resources integration independently, then each project will use its own Test Resources
server, separate of the others.

However, you might want to run the consumer in one terminal, and the producer in another, and still want them to talk to
the same Kafka cluster. For this you can use a shared test server, by passing the `micronaut.test.resources.shared`
system property, or setting `<shared>true<shared>` in the Micronaut Maven Plugin configuration.

==== Test Resource Service lifecycle

Test resources are handled by a service which is, by default, started at the beginning of a build, and stopped at the end.

For example, if you invoke:

[source,bash]
----
$ mvn test
----

Then the test resources service will be started before tests are executed, then tests will share the resources provided
by the service. Any test resource started during the test will be stopped when the build finishes.

In development mode, the test resources service is also started in the same JVM. For example, if you run:

[source,bash]
----
$ mvn mn:run
----

Then the test resources will be spawned before the application starts, and shutdown when you Ctrl+C the `mn:run`
execution.

==== Keeping the Test Resources Service alive

If you want to start the test resources service in the background, and keep it alive for multiple, independent builds
(different invocations on the command line for example), you can run the `mn:start-testresources-service` goal:

[source,bash]
----
$ mvn mn:start-testresources-service
